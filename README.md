# Flame

Flame is a flexible framework supporting predictive modeling and similarity search within the eTRANSAFE (http://etransafe.eu) project. 


Flame allows to:
- Easily develop machine-learning models, for example QSAR-like models, starting from annotated collections of chemical compounds stored in standard formats (i.e. SDFiles)
- Transfer new models into a production environment where they can be used by web services to predict the properties of new compounds.

Flame can be used in comand mode or using a web based GUI. The code for the GUI is accessible [here](https://github.com/phi-grib/flame_API). 

## Installation (binaries and docker)

We provide Windows and Linux installers (both for the Flame backend and the GUI) that can be downloaded here

1.0.0rc2:
- [Windows](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_q7YBdhxb59QAzWg7j3alyckiSC_9uv4/view?usp=sharing)
- [Linux](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bcpvBRIW0KmX-YWc4MXww1kUB1oikst5/view?usp=sharing)

Head version (recommended):
- [Windows](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hl8xBB9bqxyvy8Whqmt3rJxsz1vsceXR/view?usp=sharing)
- [Linux](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HldcEqnRoyfWFNDcwCOA1qZ4oLmLBDMC/view?usp=sharing)

A docker container (https://www.docker.com/), fully configured can be downloaded from DockerHub and installed using:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8010:8000 mpastorphi/flame
```
Then, the Flame GUI will be accesible from a web broser at http://localhost:8010

It is also possible to use an existing local folder for storing the models and the predictions generated by Flame. Let's assume you wish to use 'c:\flame_repo' as the local flame repository. Start by creating three folders inside named 'models', 'predictions', and 'spaces'. Then, run the following command: 

```bash
docker run -d -p 8010:8000 -v c:\flame_repo:/data mpastorphi/flame
```
Then, as in the previous example, you can acces the Flame GUI from a web broser at http://localhost:8010

## Documentation

A Flame walkthrough, showing some of its main features is accesible [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aX1aogDVlIDoYpBR1vu4dIxB10si_8Ex/view?usp=sharing)

Flame is described in the following open-access article:

```

```

(https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-021-00509-z)

## Installing from source code

Flame can be used in most Windows, Linux or macOS configurations, provided that a suitable execution environment is set up. We recommend, as a fist step, installing the Conda package and environment manager. Download a suitable Conda or Anaconda distribution for your operative system from [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html#)


Download the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phi-grib/flame.git
```

Go to the repository directory 

```bash
cd flame
```

and create the **conda environment** with all the dependencies and extra packages (numpy, RDKit...):

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Once the environment is created type:

```bash
source activate flame
```

to activate the environment.

Conda environments can be easily updated using a new version of the environment definition

```bash
conda env update -f new_environment.yml
```

Flame must be installed as a regular Python package. From the flame directory type (note the dot at the end):

```bash
pip install . 
```

or

```bash
python setup.py install
```

For development, use pip with the -e flag or setup with `develop` instead of `install`. This will made accesible the latest changes to other components (eg. flame_API)

```bash
pip install -e .
```
or 

```bash
python setup.py develop
```

## Configuration

After installation is completed, you must run the configuration command to configure the directory where flame will place the models and chemical spaces. If Flame has not been configured previously the following command

```bash
flame -c config
```

will suggest a default directory structure following the XDG specification in GNU/Linux, %APPDATA% in windows and `~/Library/Application Support/flame_models` in Mac OS X.

To specify a custom path use the `-d` parameter to enter the root folder where the models and chemical spaces will be placed:

```bash
flame -c config -d /my/custom/path
```

will set up the model repository to `/my/custom/path/models`, the chemical spaces repository to `/my/custom/path/spaces` and the predictions to `/my/custom/path/predictions`. 

Once Flame has been configured, the current setting can be displayed using again the command 

```bash
flame -c config
```

As a fallback, Flame can also be configured using the following command

```bash
flame -c config -a silent
```

This option sets up the models, spaces and predictions repositories within the Flame installation directory (`flame\flame\models`, `flame\flame\spaces`, `flame\flame\predictions`). Unlike other options, this command does not ask permision to the end-user to create the directories or set up the repositories and is used internally by automatic installers and for software development. 


## Main features

- Native support of most common machine-learning algorithms, including rich configuration options and facilitating the model optimization.
- Easy creation of chemical spaces for similarity search, using fingerprints or molecular descriptors.
- Support for any standard formatted input: from a tsv table to a collection of compounds in SMILES or SDFile format. 
- Multiple interfaces adapted to the needs of different users: as a web service, for end-user prediction, as a full featured GUI for model development, as command line, integration in Jupyter notebooks, etc.
- Support for parallel processing.
- Integration of models developed using other tools (e.g. R, KNIME).
- Support for multilevel models: the output of a model can be used as input for other models.
- Integrated model version management.


## Quickstarting

Flame provides a simple command-line interface `flame.py`, which is useful for accessing its functionality and getting acquainted with its use.

You can run the following commands from any terminal, in a computer where flame has been installed and the environment (flame) was activated (`source activate flame` in Linux, `activate flame` in Windows)

Let's start creating a new model:

```sh
flame -c manage -a new -e MyModel
```

This creates a new entry in the model repository and the development version of the model, populating these entries with default options.
The contents of the model repository are shown using the command.

```sh
flame -c manage -a list
```

Building a model only requires entering an input file formatted for training one of the supported machine-learning methods. In the case of QSAR models, the input file can be an SDFile, where the biological property is annotated in one of the fields. 

The details of how Flame normalizes the structures, obtains molecular descriptors and applies the machine-learning algorithm are defined in a parameters file (*parameter.yaml*) which now contains default options. These can be changed as we will describe later, but for now let's use the defaults to obtain a Random Forest model on a series of 100 compounds annotated with a biological property in the field \<activity\>: 
	
```sh
flame -c build -e MyModel -f series.sdf
```	
After a few seconds, the model is built and a summary of the model quality is presented in the screen.
This model is immediately accessible for predicting the properties of new compounds. This can be done locally using the command:
```sh
flame -c predict -e MyModel -v 0 -f query.sdf
```	
And this will show the properties predicted for the compounds in the query SDFile. 

The parameters used for building the models can be inspected using the following command:

```sh
flame -c manage -e MyModel -a parameters
```	

In order to customize the model building we need to pass as an argument of build a file containing any change we want to introduce. This is what we call a "delta" file. Delta files can be easily generated by redirecting the output of the above command to a text file...

```sh
flame -c manage -e MyModel -a parameters > delta.txt
```	

... and then editing it. The new, edited file can be used in the build command as follows:

```sh
flame -c build -e MyModel -f series.sdf -p delta.txt
```

For model documentation we need to obtain a delta file which will already include some information extracted from both the parameters and the quality metrics from model building. Other fields are empty as they requiere of manual filling (ie: institution info or model interpretation). Delta file documentation can be obtained by executing:

```sh
flame -c manage -e MyModel -a documentation > delta.txt
```	

The file `delta.txt` can be edited to include all the required information. After the edition, changes can be made persistent by executing the following command:

```sh
flame -c manage -e MyModel -a documentation -t delta.txt
```

Flame can also use as input a TSV file, containing all the X and Y values required to build the model. This file must have the following format: columnn must be separated by a single tab. The first row must contain variable names. One row per compound. Molecule names are optional but, if present, must be placed in the first column. SMILES are optional, but can be inserted in any column with the label `SMILES` (all capitals). The activity must be placed in a column with the label specified by the parameter `TSV_activity`.

The commands for building a model or predicting from a TSV file are identical to the ones used with SDFiles. Please make sure that in the parameter file, the `input_type` is set to `data`.

```sh
flame -c build -e MyModel -f series.tsv 
```

```sh
flame -c predict -e MyModel -f query.tsv 
```


In the above commands we specified the model version used for the prediction. So far we only have a model in the development folder (version 0). This version will be overwritten every time we develop a new model for this endpoint. Let's imagine that we are very satisfied with our model and want to store it for future use. We can obtain a persistent copy of it with the command
```sh
flame -c manage -a publish -e MyModel
```	
This will create model version 1. We can list existing versions for a given endpoint using the list command mentioned below
```sh
flame -c manage -e MyModel -a list
```	
Now, the output says we have a published version of model MyModel. 

Imagine that the model is so good you want to send it elsewhere, for example a company that wants to obtain predictions for confidential compounds in their own computing facilities. The model can be exported using the command
```sh
flame -c manage -a export -e MyModel
```	
This creates a very compact file with the extension .tgz in the local directory. It can be sent by e-mail or uploaded to a repository in the cloud from where the company can download it. In order to use it, the company can easily install the new model using the command
```sh
flame -c manage -a import -f MyModel.tgz
```	
And then the model is immediately operative and able to produce exactly the same predictions we obtain in the development environment  

To test the similarity search capabilities of Flame create a new chemical space:

```sh
flame -c manage -a new -s MySpace
```

This creates a new entry in the spaces repository and the development version of the chemical space, populating these entries with default options.

Now provide the collection of compounds to include in the chemical space as a SDFile and set up the parameters (e.g. the molecular descriptors used to characterize it) using a delta file, as described above for the models.

You can obtain the current parameters by using the command:

```sh
flame -c manage -s MySpace -a parameters > delta.txt
```	

The file `delta.txt` can be edited and then the new parameters can be applied by making reference to the edited file in the sbuild command, as follows:

```sh
flame -c sbuild -s MySpace -f series.sdf -p delta.txt
```

Once it was built, this chemical space can be used to search compounds similar to a given query compounds in an efficient way.

```sh
flame -c search -s MySpace -v 0 -f query.sdf -p similarity.yaml
```
The file `query.sdf` can contain the chemical structure of one or many compounds. The file `similarity.yaml` must define the metric used for the search, the distance cutoff and the maximum number of similars to extract per query compound. The last two fields can be left empty to avoid applying these limits.

## Flame GUI

You can install Flame_API (https://github.com/phi-grib/flame_API) to access most of the functionalities using a simple web application.

Please refer to the manual page of Flame_API for further information


## Technical details


### Using Flame

Flame was designed to be used in different ways, using diverse interfaces. For example:
- Using a web GUI
- Using the `flame.py` command described above
- As a Python package, making direct calls to the high-level objects *predict*, *build* or *manage*
- As a Python package, making calls to the lower level objects *idata*, *apply*, *learn*, *odata*


### Developing models

Typically, Flame models are developed by modeling engineers. This task requires importing an appropriate training series and defininig the model building workflow. 

Model building can be easily customized with the Flame modeling GUI or by modifying the parameters defined in a command file (called *parameters.yaml*) by passing a file with the new parameter values at building time (using parameter -p/--parameters, as descrive above). Then, the model can be built using the `flame.py` build command, and its quality can be assessed in an iterative process which is repeated until optimum results are obtained. This task can also be carried out making calls to the objects mentioned above from an interactive Python environment, like a Jupyter notebook. A full documentation of the library can be obtained running Doxygen on the root directory.

Advanced users can customize the models by editting the objects *idata_child*, *appl_child*, *learn_child* and *odata_child* present at the *model/dev* folder. These empty objects are childs of the corresponding objects called by flame, and it is possible to override any of the parents' methods simply by copying and editing these whitin the childs' code files.

Models can be published to obtain persistent versions, usable for predicton in the same environment, or exported for using them in external production environments, as described above.

### Incremental re-training of existing models

Existing model can be re-built using the option -inc (or --incremental) when the model is built to add the compounds present in the input file to the existing training series.

For example, imagine 'MyModel' is a model generated using a series of 1000 compounds and 'series.sdf' contains a collection of 500 additional compounds 

```sh
flame -c build -e MyModel -f series.sdf -inc
```

This command will add all the compounds present in the file 'series.sdf' at the end of the existing training series, thus generating a new model with 1500 compounds.

In this process no checking for dupplicate molecules or any other test is carried out.

### Documenting models

When a new model is created an empty documentation template is generated in the model folder. All the fields related with the modeling methodology and the model quality evaluation are automatically completed when the model is built, but other fields (e.g. author name, institution, mechanism, result interpretation) require manual user input. The mechanism for completing this template is similar to the method used to complete the parameters. The command 

```sh
flame -c manage -e MyModel -a documentation > MyModel-documentation.yaml
```

can be used to dump the half-filled template to a plain text file, which can be edited to complete the missing information. Then, once completed, we can use the command

```sh
flame -c manage -e MyModel -a documentation -t MyModel-documentation.yaml
```
to introduce the existing information in the internal model documentation template. 

The model documentation can be shown in the screen using the first command without output redirectioning

```sh
flame -c manage -e MyModel -a documentation
```

Internally, the documentation mimics the fields of the OECD-QMRF reports. 

### Runnning models

Models built in Flame can be used for obtaining predictions using diverse methods. We can use the command mode interface with a simple call:
```sh
flame -c predict -e MyModel -v 1 -f query.sdf
```
This allows to integate the prediction in scripts, or workflow tools like KNIME and Pipeline Pilot.

Also, the models can run as prediction web-services. These services can be consumed by the stand-alone web GUI provided and described above or connected to a more complex platform, like the one currently in development in the eTRANSAFE project.
